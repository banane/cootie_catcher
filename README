The Cootie Catcher, oh, that ageless game that young girls in playgrounds play around the world.

With a few turns of fate you can find your fortune!

Enter a few colors, select from our rainbow, or have the computer dynamically select 4 for you.

You pick a color.

Then, you pick a number.

Then, you pick another number.

Voila, the genie in the bottle decides your imminent, or not so imminent, future.

Coming to theaters near you, soon.
